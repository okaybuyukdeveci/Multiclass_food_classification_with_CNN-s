# Multiclass_food_classification_with_CNN-s

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of food into various categories. The model is trained on a dataset containing multiple classes of food images.

## Important Note

While the model aims to achieve high accuracy, it is important to understand that it may not guarantee 100% accuracy on all classifications due to factors such as image quality, class similarities, and variability in the dataset.
